# NOX_emmision
Used four models to predict NOX emmision from gas turbine
Project was done on a data of a gas turbine, given features were:
* Ambient temperature (AT) C 
* Ambient pressure (AP) mbar 
* Ambient humidity (AH) (%) 
* Air filter difference pressure (AFDP) mbar 
* Gas turbine exhaust pressure (GTEP) mbar
* Turbine inlet temperature (TIT) C 
* Turbine after temperature (TAT) C
* Compressor discharge pressure (CDP) mbar 
* Turbine energy yield (TEY) MWH 
* Carbon monoxide (CO) mg/m3 


and the target was to find  Nitrogen oxides (NOx) mg/m3.
it was regression problem, used multiple methods in order to achieve beter accuracy, with Feature engineering and feature selection.
